## ⚡ What is CliRelay?

> **✨ Heavily enhanced fork of the [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) project** — rebuilt with a production-grade management layer, web control panel hosting, and a terminal TUI for day-2 operations.

CliRelay lets you **proxy requests** from AI coding tools and compatible API clients (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Amp CLI, OpenAI-compatible clients, etc.) through a single unified endpoint. Authenticate with OAuth, API keys, cookies, or a mix of them, and CliRelay handles routing, failover, usage logging, `/manage` web hosting, and terminal management workflows automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Download & Configure

```bash
# Download the latest release for your platform from GitHub Releases
# Then copy the example config
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml

# Optional: build locally from source
go build -o cli-proxy-api ./cmd/server
```

Edit `config.yaml` to add your API keys or OAuth credentials.

### 2️⃣ Run

```bash
./cli-proxy-api -config ./config.yaml
# Server: http://localhost:8317
# Web panel (if enabled): http://localhost:8317/manage
```

The release artifact is currently named `cli-proxy-api`. The `clirelay` command shown later is a helper wrapper installed by `install.sh`, not the raw server binary name.

### Useful CLI Modes

```bash
# OAuth / credential flows
./cli-proxy-api -login
./cli-proxy-api -codex-login
./cli-proxy-api -codex-device-login
./cli-proxy-api -claude-login
./cli-proxy-api -qwen-login
./cli-proxy-api -iflow-login
./cli-proxy-api -iflow-cookie
./cli-proxy-api -antigravity-login
./cli-proxy-api -kimi-login

# Admin interfaces
./cli-proxy-api -tui
./cli-proxy-api -tui -standalone

# Other utilities
./cli-proxy-api -vertex-import ./service-account.json
./cli-proxy-api -oauth-callback-port 18080 -no-browser
```

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)

**One-Click Deploy**:

- Linux `amd64` / `arm64`: supported for automatic Docker installation
- macOS `arm64` / `amd64`: supported when Docker Desktop / OrbStack / Colima is already installed and running

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kittors/CliRelay/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script will:

- automatically install Docker when needed
- detect the host architecture and pin the correct Docker platform for `amd64` / `arm64`
- let you choose **English** or **Chinese** during installation
- persist that language into the container so the built-in TUI starts in the selected language by default
- install a local `clirelay` helper command for day-2 operations

On macOS, the installer will **not** try to install Docker for you. It will reuse your existing Docker runtime and stop with a clear message if Docker Desktop / OrbStack / Colima is not running.

After installation, use:

```bash
clirelay status
clirelay update
clirelay restart
clirelay logs
clirelay tui
```

`clirelay update` keeps the existing configuration and only refreshes the image + containers, so ongoing upgrades stay simple.

> 💡 If `curl` is not installed, install it first:
> ```bash
> # Debian / Ubuntu
> apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
>
> # CentOS / RHEL / Fedora
> yum install -y curl
> ```

Or deploy manually with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The included `docker-compose.yml` uses the published `ghcr.io/kittors/clirelay:latest` image by default, so a fresh clone follows the normal production deployment path and does not compile Go on the target machine.

The bundled `build:` section is kept as a local fallback for source-level verification or emergency rebuilds. If you explicitly want to force a local build from the checked out source instead of pulling GHCR:

```bash
CLI_PROXY_IMAGE=clirelay-local:dev CLI_PROXY_PULL_POLICY=never docker compose up -d
```

For manual Docker deployments, you can also set `CLIRELAY_LOCALE=en` or `CLIRELAY_LOCALE=zh` in your Compose environment to control the default TUI language.

### 🗄️ Enabling Data Persistence

By default, API usage logs are stored in SQLite for persistence. For additional backup:
1. Ensure you have a Redis server running.
2. Edit `config.yaml` and set `redis.enable: true` with your Redis address.
CliRelay will automatically snapshot and restore traffic metrics on every startup!

For large installations, tune `request-log-storage` in `config.yaml` to control how full request/response bodies are retained. By default, full bodies are compressed, kept for 30 days, and capped at ~1GB (1024MB); lightweight request metadata remains queryable for longer-term statistics. Set `content-retention-days: 0` to keep full content indefinitely, set `store-content: false` to stop new body storage without deleting existing historical content, and adjust `max-total-size-mb` to cap body storage so the oldest full bodies are pruned before the retention window is reached.

If you need non-local config/auth persistence, the server also supports PostgreSQL, Git-backed, and S3-compatible object-store backends through environment-based bootstrap settings.

### 3️⃣ Point Your Tools

Set your AI tool's API base to `http://localhost:8317` and start coding!

**Example: OpenAI Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`)**
```toml
[model_providers.tabcode]
name = "openai"
base_url = "http://localhost:8317/v1"
requires_openai_auth = true
```

## 🖥️ Management Panel

When the control panel is enabled, open:

```bash
http://localhost:8317/manage
```

- `remote-management.disable-control-panel` now defaults to `false` in the example config and installer-generated config, so the control panel is reachable after a standard deployment.
- When enabled, the current panel route is `/manage/login`. The old `management.html#/login` route is legacy-only.
- Official Docker installs and the published image expose the panel at `/manage`.
- The server can serve a bundled SPA directory or auto-fetch panel assets when needed.
- This repository contains the hosting/update path for `/manage`; the standalone web panel source is maintained separately from the Go server code.
- Terminal-first management is also available through `clirelay tui` or `./cli-proxy-api -tui`.
- If you want to customize the panel asset source, set `remote-management.panel-github-repository`.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements & Special Thanks

This project is a deeply enhanced fork built upon the excellent core logic of the open-source **[router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI)** project.
We want to express our deepest gratitude to the original **CLIProxyAPI** project and all its contributors!

It is thanks to the solid, innovative proxy distribution foundation built by the upstream that we were able to stand on the shoulders of giants. This allowed us to develop unique advanced management features (like API Key tracking & control, full request logging with SQLite, and real-time system monitoring) and rebuild an entirely new frontend dashboard from scratch.

A huge salute to the spirit of open source! ❤️
